    <p>Shino seems to be talking a lot. He's a good teacher.. and why are you badmouthing Boruto? He's cute. He looks like Naruto. His personality is similar. And is it true that in Boruto there's a god-like being that would win if Naruto and Sasuke fought?? And I looked it up on the internet, is this really true?? Is that god-level monster from Boruto? - Look at Naruto and Sasuke combined. I was so shocked when I saw this that I just let out "Wow" ;; Seriously, that's fucking crazy.. If that's real, you really have to see it. It's not like it's going to destroy the world..</p>
    <p>Wow, I really wanted to cry when I saw Naruto and Sasuke become like that.. I'm watching it because it's Borutog, but is this real..? Sigh.. I really want to see Sasuke.. I really wonder when they became god-level powerhouses. It reminds me of the old days, when I was in middle school, and I'm sad, happy, touched, and have complicated emotions.. Anyway, Naruto is truly the greatest masterpiece in anime..</p>
